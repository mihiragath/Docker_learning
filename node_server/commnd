docker build -t my-node-app .
to built docker image
This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory

for mapping port to run code container machin to out desktop machine
docker run -it/-itd -p machine_port:container_post -p machine_port:container_post -p machine_port:container_post app_name
or
for multiple ports running easily
docker run -it/-itd -P app-name difference between -it means its block the terminal or -itd meand container run in background not block terminal
or
docker run -itd/-it -P --rm app-name after close container container automatically removed

build image according to hub.docker.com web docker publish repository
docker build -t mihiragath/example_app

to push code on publish repository use push command
docker push mihiragath/example_app

to use out publish doker file
